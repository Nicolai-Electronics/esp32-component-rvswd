# RVSWD programmer component

This component enables an ESP32 host to program an RVSWD compatible target. RVSWD is a custom two wire programming protocol used by WCH in their CH32 line of microcontrollers.

Currently the component only supports and has only been tested on the **CH32V203** microcontroller.

## Background 

This component has been developed for loading firmware onto the coprocessor of the [Tanmatsu](https://nicolaielectronics.nl/docs/tanmatsu/) dream terminal device for hackers, makers and tech enthousiasts.
