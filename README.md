# RVSWD programmer component

This component enables an ESP32 host to program an RVSWD compatible target. RVSWD is a custom two wire programming protocol used by WCH in their CH32 line of microcontrollers.

Currently the component only supports and has only been tested on the **CH32V203** microcontroller.
